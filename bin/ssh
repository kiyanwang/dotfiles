# Simple script that switches your iTerm2 Profile when using ssh.
# You'll need to export three environment variables:
# - SSH_DEFAULT_THEME
# - SSH_DANGER_THEME
# - SSH_WARNING_THEME
#
# The values for these must correspond exactly to the name of an iTerm Profile you have
# created. Within the Profile you can set the color/themes you wish to use.
#
# The script parses the hostname out of the ssh connection string (naive) and
# uses this in a case statement to set the theme. Add as many cases as you like.
#
# To use this either put this script or a symlink to it into /usr/local/bin
